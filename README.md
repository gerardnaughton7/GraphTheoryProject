# GraphTheoryProject
Graph Theory project to create and design a Neo4j database and prototype for a third level college timetabling system.

## Introduction
In my project I will design neo4j database and outline the steps I took to achieve this. This includes going through what data was needed, How i would retrieve the data that needed to be stored, my design strategy for the database eg node, edges and there attributes and the relationship between them, how to implement the design and finally conclusion.

## What is Neo4j

Neo4j is a graph database management system. It is developed by Neo Technology. It is a [ACID](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ACID)-compliant transactional database wnith native graph storage and processing.

Neo4j is available in many different licences depending on your needs. I am using the open-source community edition. Neo4j is java based and accessible from software written in other languages using the their Cypher Query language. Similar the way mySql has sql language.

In a neo4j database the data is structured and stored using edges, nodes and attributes. Each node and edge can have any number of attributes. Nodes and edges can also have labels which can help narrow down searches of the database.

Neo4j is quickly becoming one of the leaders not just in graph databases but databases in general. With its high perfomant read and write scalability, without compromise. With figures of over 1 million downloads and growing at a rate of 50000 downloads a month, it looks set that neo4j is here to stay.

Here are some of the big name companies using Neo4j:
* Walmart
* eBay
* Adidas
* Cisco

## Data to be stored
putting together what information is need for this database and why
where we can retrieve this information

## How Data was retrieved
How we retrieved the data from GMIT. Galway mayo institute of technology - web timetables.
http://timetable.gmit.ie/.

## Design Strategy
how you would like to implement the data into the neo4j database and relationships etc
how we would use the database to query these using cypher

## Implementation
how we input the information to the database
how we set up the relationships etc
how someone would query the database
types of queries we used

## Conclusion
how i found the project
would i recommend it
