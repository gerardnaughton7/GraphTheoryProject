# GraphTheoryProject
Graph Theory project to create and design a Neo4j database and prototype for a third level college timetabling system.

## Intro
Explain goals of project

## What is Neo4j
explain what is a neo4j database
give helpful links if people want to more in depth
explain companies that have adopted this type of database
explain why people are using this type of database

## Data to be stored
putting together what information is need for this database and why
where we can retrieve this information

## How Data was retrieved
How we retrieved the data from GMIT. Galway mayo institute of technology - web timetables.
http://timetable.gmit.ie/.

## Design Strategy
how you would like to implement the data into the neo4j database and relationships etc
how we would use the database to query these using cypher

## Implementation
how we input the information to the database
how we set up the relationships etc
how someone would query the database
types of queries we used

## Conclusion
how i found the project
would i recommend it
